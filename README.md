## Hi there 👋 I'm Divine Ugorji


I am a software engineer based in Nigeria.

Curiosity about tech and passion about problem solving is what got me into code, 
being able to come up with creative solutions is what makes me stay.

I enjoy learning as much as I enjoy teaching, I think both are equally fulfilling activities to me, 
and when I look for a job, continuous learning is a priority.

I spend most of my days coding and contributing to discussions in tech communitites, 
if I am not doing that, I am out reading history, psychology books and meeting friends and family.

I take my craft seriously but just having fun.
