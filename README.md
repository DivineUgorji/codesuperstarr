## Hi there 👋 I'm Divine Ugorji

[![Header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/<OWNER>/<OWNER>/readme_header.png "Header")](https://some-url.dev/)

I am a software engineer based in Nigeria.

Passion about problem solving is what got me into code, being able to come up with creative solutions is what makes me stay.

I enjoy learning as much as I enjoy teaching, I think both are equally fulfilling activities to me, and when I look for a job, continuous learning is a priority.

I spend most of my days coding and contributing to discussions in tech communitites, if I am not doing that, I am out reading history, psychology books and meeting friends and family.

I take my craft seriously but just having fun.
